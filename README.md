# Dili-Toli!

A 15 puzzle built in React that
1. pulls a random square image from Flickr,
2. segments it into 16 squares, 
3. blanks out the bottom right corner square,
4. mixes up the squares by making a hundred random valid moves.

> The name is a Hungarian pun: "tili-toli" is informal for this kind of game, and "dili" means something like "going bananas".

# Sliding image puzzle

A sliding puzzle that doesn't really work (yet!), written in React.

## To see it in action

### Locally

1. Clone the repository.

2. In the root of the project folder, run `npm install` to generate the `node_modules` folder with the project dependencies.

3. Run `npm run build` to make Webpack build the app, and bundle it as a script with the HTML to serve.

4. Run `npm run start`, a script that runs `node server.js`, which in turn starts an Express server, and serve the project locally.

5. Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser of choice.

### In the wild

A version of the project which actually works slightly better than the one you can build from this source is available [on Codepen](https://codepen.io/aproragadozo/pen/yzxdea).

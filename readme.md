A sliding puzzle that doesn't really work, written in React.

Various experimental phases of the project are available at on Codepen, [here](https://codepen.io/aproragadozo/pen/yzxdea) and [here](https://codepen.io/aproragadozo/pen/ZXQJVN).

I would really like to make this work, but haven't had the time lately, and feel that I'd need a higher level of maths to make it work.
